# DBL Embedded Systems - Group 6
## Code repository 
This is the git repository in which all of the shared source code will be stored.

### Access to the repository
* Every member of the team has full access to the repository. In order to make a local clone in which you can work, consider taking a look at [this tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github).
* Like usual, if you want to update the code on the repository, first *commit* your changes (with a sensible commit message is possible), and then perform a *push*. 
* It is always a good idea to perform a *pull* before you start working, as this ensures you have the latest version of all the code.
* If the *push* does not work, perform a *pull* first.
* **Note: Be very careful with merging, as it may overwrite code that you do not want to change**
* **Note: Do not create separate branches. This introduces the tricky task of merging branches later on, so we should aim for "trunk-based development".**
